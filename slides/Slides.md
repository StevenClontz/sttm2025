## Abstract

A standard introductory result is that Hausdorff spaces have the property 
US, that is, each convergent sequence has a unique limit. This paper 
explores several existing and new characterizations of separation axioms 
that are strictly weaker than Hausdorff but strictly stronger than US.

## Where our story begins.

In [1], Wilansky published a systematic overview of two properties strictly 
between $T_2$ and $T_1$: **KC (Kompacts are Closed)** and
**US (converging Sequences have Unique limits)**.

One may show that

$$T_2 \Rightarrow KC \Rightarrow US \Rightarrow T_1$$

with no arrows reversing.

## But why am I interested in this?

My dirty secret: I'm only a part-time topologist these days. ðŸ˜¢

&nbsp;

A major part of my active scholarly program is focused on
**digital research infrastructure** for mathematics, and I have a 
particular interest in **databases of research mathematics**. ðŸ’»

And my favorite database? The
[$\pi$-Base community database of topological counterexamples](https://topology.pi-base.org),
of course.

## What is needed to contribute properties like KC and US to the $\pi$-Base?

- Notability
  - [KC (P100)](https://topology.pi-base.org/properties/P000100) and 
    [US (P99)](https://topology.pi-base.org/properties/P000099) 
    are indeed properties recognized in the literature.
- Connections
  - The theorems $T_2\Rightarrow KC$, $KC\Rightarrow US$, and
    $US\Rightarrow T_1$ connect these properties to others known to
    $\pi$-Base.
- Counter-examples
  - Spaces (e.g.)
    [Cocountable topology on $\mathbb R$ (S17)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces/S000017),
    [Square of one-point compactificiation of $\mathbb Q$ (S31)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces/S000031),
    and
    [Cofinite topology on $\mathbb Z$ (S15)](https://topology.pi-base.org/spaces/S000017)
    witness that each implication does not reverse.

## Done! Now what?

Part of what's fun about contributing to $\pi$-Base today is that there's 
still so much ground to cover to catch up to the current state of the 
literature.

- It seems Patrick Rabau was the
  first to observe in 2021 [2]
  that the
  [**wH** (Weak Hausdorff, P143)](https://topology.pi-base.org/properties/P000143)
  property lies strictly between KC and US.
- Madison and Lawson define **kH** (k-Hausdorff) in [3], and showed it
  lives between $T_2$ and KC.
- Rezk also defines kH in [4], and showed it is implied by wH.

## Cleaning up k-Hausdorff

On Math StackExchange [5], Rabau and I took a careful look at
the kH property. In both [2] and [3], a space was defined to be
k-Hausdorff provided that its diagonal is **k-closed**.

The trick is that there are two inequivalent definitions of k-closed
in the literature. Let's say a set is **$k_1$-closed** provided
its intersection with every compact subspace is closed, and
**$k_2$-closed** provided its intersection with the image of any
compact Hausdroff space is closed. We then obtain the respective
definitions for what we will now call
[**$k_1$H** ($k_1$-Hausdorff, P170)](https://topology.pi-base.org/properties/P000170)
and
[**$k_2$H** ($k_2$-Hausdorff, P171)](https://topology.pi-base.org/properties/P000171)

## Putting it together

$$T_2\Rightarrow k_1H \Rightarrow KC \Rightarrow wH \Rightarrow k_2H
\Rightarrow US \Rightarrow T_1$$

with no arrows reversing.

## Generalizing US

Let's dig into another definition for $k_2H$:

> For every compact Hausdorff space $K$, continuous map $f:K\to X$,
and points $k,l\in K$ with $f(k)\not=f(l)$, there exist open neighborhoods
$U,V$ of $k,l$ with $f[U]\cap f[V]=\emptyset$.

Letting $K=\omega+1$ and we easily see why $k_2H\Rightarrow US$.
But what about other types of sequences?

---

## Transfinite sequences

Define a **transfinite sequence** to be a function from a limit
ordinal $\alpha$ into a topological space. Note that every
$\omega$-length (transfinite) sequence is **continuous**, but
longer transfinite sequences need not be.

A **limit** of a transfinite sequence is a point such that every
neighborhood contains a final tail of the sequence; the limit is
said to **converge** to this limit.
