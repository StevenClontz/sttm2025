## Abstract

A standard introductory result is that Hausdorff spaces have the property US, that is, each convergent sequence has a unique limit. This paper explores several existing and new characterizations of separation axioms that are strictly weaker than Hausdorff but strictly stronger than US.

## Where our story begins.

In [0], Wilansky published a systematic overview of two properties strictly between $T_2$ and $T_1$: **KC (Kompacts are Closed)** and **US (converging Sequences have Unique limits)**.

One may show that

$$T_2 \Rightarrow KC \Rightarrow US \Rightarrow T_1$$

with no arrows reversing.

## But why am I interested in this?

My dirty secret: I'm only a part-time topologist these days. ðŸ˜²

A big part of my active scholarly program is focused on **research infrastructure** for mathematics, and I have a particular interest in **databases of research mathematics**.

My favorite database through? The [$\pi$-Base community database of topological counterexamples](https://topology.pi-base.org).
